Problems for app to solve: 

Having useful information in a central hub
Ability to organize the information you want.  
Easier for people who are not technically savvy.

Solutions: 

Choosing widgets that are for daily use. 
Appeal of large demographic due to entertainment-themed widgets.
Mobile responsiveness 

User Story: 

As a busy individual, I want to get my daily updates (eg. Weather and news) as soon as I can, so it gives me an efficient way to start my day.

Main Goal: saving time searching for all your daily updates 
Secondary Goal: user-friendly for people who don’t know how to use most aspects of a computer for searching the web 

Organizing all of your morning searches into one clean and concise landing page. 
Many dashboards make it easy to search for information but few allow you to multi-task between your most essential searches in the morning
